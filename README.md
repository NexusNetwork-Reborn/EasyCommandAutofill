EasyCommandAutofill is a plugin which adds commands to the client's autofill system by parsing usage messages. By adding this plugin to your server, all command usages written in the vanilla style will be parsed and sent to the client with autofill enabled.

# Features
* Enables autofill on commands in your server

# Future Additions
* Parsing support for pocketmine default usage messages which do not follow vanilla style
* Multi-lingual support for multiple language parsing

# About
This plugin was made in my spare time because I was bored. No backstory or anything to follow along with here like in my other plugins' about sections. Maybe next time?
