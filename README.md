EasyCommandAutofill is a plugin which adds type-specified command args to Minecraft's autofill by parsing command usage messages. By adding this plugin to your server, all command usages written in the [vanilla style](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/commandsintroduction#command-syntax) will be parsed and sent to Minecraft with autofill enabled.

# Features
* Enables autofill for commands on your server
* Reusable custom command argument types
* Multi-language support using [PocketMine's language API](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/tree/59de045ecbacfb9acc297e75170819727d68ae09/src/lang)

# Future Additions
* Parsing support for usage messages which do not follow [vanilla style](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/commandsintroduction#command-syntax)
* More interactions with [PlayerSelectors](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/PlayerSelectors)

# About
This plugin was made in my spare time because I was bored. No backstory or anything to follow along with here like in my other plugins' about sections. Maybe next time?
